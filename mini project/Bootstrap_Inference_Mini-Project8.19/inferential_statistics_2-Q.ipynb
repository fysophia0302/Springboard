Such inference relies on theory largely developed from the 19th-Century onwards that is subject to certain assumptions or theoretical limits. These are fine if those assumptions hold for the particular case you're working on, and what you want to do has a known theoretical distribution (for example the mean of a sampling distribution that we looked at in the previous mini-project.)"

If frequentism is about using assumptions and theoretical results to calculate what we expect to happen were an experiment to be run again and again and again, then bootstrapping is about using computing power to essentially re-run the sample draw again and again and again to see what actually happens."
